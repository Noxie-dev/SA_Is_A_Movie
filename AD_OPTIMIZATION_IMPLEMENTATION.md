## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL (if not already installed)
# Create database
createdb saisa_ad_optimization

# Run migrations
psql -U postgres -d saisa_ad_optimization < migrations/001_ad_optimization.sql
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Add to your Netlify site settings:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:port/database
AD_OPTIMIZATION_ENABLED=true
ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-YOUR-ID
PRIVACY_MODE=strict
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Already installed: recharts
# No additional dependencies needed!
```

### 4. Integration Example
```jsx
import { AdOptimizedBlogPost } from './components/AdOptimizedBlogPost';

function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <AdOptimizedBlogPost
      postId="amapiano-festival-2024"
      content={blogContent}
      title="Amapiano Festival Rocks Johannesburg"
      category="music"
    />
  );
