```

## 🔧 **Alternative: Quick Test Without Contentful**

If you want to test the site without setting up Contentful immediately:

   ```
   VITE_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=fxocdfoz
   VITE_SANITY_DATASET=production
   VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-production-clerk-key
   ```

2. **Leave Contentful variables empty** - the site will work without Contentful content

## 📞 **Need Help?**

If you need help getting your Contentful or Clerk values:
1. **Contentful**: Check your Contentful dashboard for API keys
2. **Clerk**: Check your Clerk dashboard for production keys
3. **Sanity**: Already configured with `fxocdfoz` project

## ✅ **Expected Results After Fix:**

- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Sanity content loads properly
- ✅ Clerk authentication works
- ✅ Contentful content loads (if configured)
- ✅ Site functions normally
